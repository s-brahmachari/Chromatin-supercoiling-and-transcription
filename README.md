# Chromatin supercoiling


Overview
-------

This code minimizes the free energy of a chromatin fiber to predict its torque response as a funtion of the linking number constraint. The torque depends on the linear density of nuclesomes, which is held fixed during the minimization. 
The nucleosomes may undergo chiral transitions, where the linking number associated with a nucleosome may tkae discrete values corresponding to the chiral states.
